# StockHawk
Google's Android Developer Nanodegree, Project 3.

In this task I was given a basic, functional project. It had some bugs, missing features, missing accessibility descriptions. The project was not ready for translation as well.

Tasks that I did in this project:
- Each stock quote on the main screen is clickable and leads to a new screen which graphs the stock's value over time.
- Stock Hawk does not crash when a user searches for a non-existent stock.
- Stock Hawk Stocks can be displayed in a collection widget.
- Stock Hawk app has content descriptions for all buttons.
- Stock Hawk app supports layout mirroring using both the RTL attribute and the start/end tags.
- Strings are all included in the strings.xml file and untranslatable strings have a translatable tag marked to false.

And on top of these:
- App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines.
